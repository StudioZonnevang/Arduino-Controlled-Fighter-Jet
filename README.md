LICENCE:
 
OBJECTIVE:
This project loosely focusses on the research question: 
Can the internal accelerometer used in the Arduino Nano ble 33 be used as an intuitive controller for a video game

furthermore, it functioned as a means for me to become more familliar with 
Serial Port Communication, 
Game Code Architecture, 
Procedural Generation,
3D modelling and
3D printing.

CONCLUSION:
Not yet formulated.
